24.3. -- 26.3.
: I want to go climb in Niemisel, if I can find someone to climb with.

27.3. -- 2.4.
: Ski holiday, probably in SyÃ¶te.

### Climb 8a by Fall 2024
I've been semi-perpetually frustrated with my climbing after moving to Finland in 2019, and dislocating my kneecap that same summer. I want to either get better, or relegate the sport to a fun hobby and pick up something new.

Sticking with the first option for now, I have done some assessments and it is pretty clear my finger strength and core strength are lacking. Fall 2024 should give me enough time to get my fingers strong enough to move into new grades.

> 1. Recognize the need for change. 
> 2. Revolt against old behavior and habits. 
> 3. Resolve to be consistent and persistent. 
> 4. Define Point B: what you want to achieve, clearly. 
> 5. Define Point A: an honest, unsentimental account of your present state. 
> 6. Decide on a deadline, and give yourself a penalty for missing it. Be realistic. 
> 7. Design the training program: seek guidance. 
>
> In short, build a solid foundation, write a long training history, and accept a longer trajectory. If you need it three months from now you should have started three months ago. At least. There are no shortcuts. This is a long-term process and it should last for the rest of your life. You will not "arrive".

Most goal setting systems include something similar, but it seems that the part 5, here, is too often ignored: where (and when) you want to be doesn't take into account the starting point honestly enough, and the goal set remains more of a wish of where you would be _now_ than a tangible target, with a deadline and a plan.

### Learning programming
When I was in University, the basic programming course was still taught with Java. In addition I took courses using C and C++, and some of the engineering classes used Matlab or R. Professionally, I have used Matlab, R, Python and SQL.

#### Ruby
Recently I wanted to get back into basics of programming again, also to how it would feel like. Ruby (and Rails) seems to be well-loved by its users, and the book [Eloquent Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104) came with a great recommendation.

#### Javascript & web dev
I quickly realized that the things I wanted to build  would not make sense to build using purely a server side framework, without any Javascript -- ignoring stuff like [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) for now. Having dabbled in web projects (and even Vue) before, I hadn't taken the time to _formally_ learn Javascript until now.

I started working on an interval timer app (for hangboarding), but wanting to learn the concepts of web development at the same time lead me to thinking about state and where it should be stored. Additionally, making a hangboard timer makes it necessary for the timer to be able to run while in background --- because let's face it, you might not resist the urge to post on r/ClimbingCircleJerk during your rest periods --- which necessitates the use of web workers.

E.g. <https://codesandbox.io/s/timer-using-web-worker-w2or0> --- example not mine. For state management, one of the more useful examples in vanilla Javascript was this: [From Scratch - Reactive Values](https://dev.to/emnudge/from-scratch-reactive-values-c9h).

The books I have been reading for Javascript are:

* David Flanagan: [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596101996/wrrrldwideweb)
* Douglas Crockford: [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742)

### Business? Work?

### Olympic lifting
I took a course for olympic lifting in spring 2021, but it has been a long process to get comfortable enough with overhead squats (and just having weight overhead, especially for snatches) to start moving appreciable weight.

Right now my workouts consist of muscle snatches and overhead squats, with the idea of hopefully getting comfortable and building capacity to make full technique work easier.

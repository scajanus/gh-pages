I have a Master’s degree in Computational & Cognitive Bioscience -- in practice, applied statistics with a big focus on Bayesian methods. During my studies, I worked as a research assistant in Aki Vehtari’s research group for Bayesian modeling, and took courses including Gaussian processes, Kalman filtering, point pattern modeling. I also worked as a teaching assistant for the local Statistics 101 course, and have kept my basic understanding of probability and statistics fresh over the years.

Since graduating, I have worked in the marine industry, opinion research, healthcare and most recently building internal tooling and pricing for consumer surplus commerce. I've worked in analyst, product owner and software development positions, mostly in modeling or data processing applications.

Currently I amjliving in Helsinki, Finland, but in the past I have lived on Cát Bà, Vietnam, in Laos commuting between Green Climbers Home in Thakhek and Vientiane, as well as in Berlin. I've crossed two continents overland: Helsinki to Shanghai as well as Vancouver to New York.
